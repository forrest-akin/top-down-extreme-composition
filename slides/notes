JS.LA PRESENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

What did you want?
    I wanted expressive, declarative code with consistent reasonability and safe refactorability

Why did you want it?
    I was tired of having to spend so much time and energy trying to understand how existing code
    was working in order to safely modify it

What led to the creation of what you are demoing?
    frustration with the failure of standard coding practices to achieve evolvability in software


What did you do to get what you wanted?
    feeling that there must be a better way I found FP and fell in love with the expressivity and
    simplicity it achieved. the more I struggled with software at work the deeper I dove into FP
    and discovered how easily it solved all the issues we struggled with at work

What did you do to create your thing?
    I constantly experiment with different ways to structure and format code. I love simple ideas
    that I can get a ton of mileage out of; ideally can be applied universally. I'm currently
    really in to maximizing purity and compositionality


What went wrong?
    Even though I had found a much more satisfactory way of thinking about software, I struggled to
    find an approach that enabled me to focus on one thing at a time without related details
    leaking into and hogging precious mental resources

What went right?
    I started working at CJ Affiliate and immediately saw the impact top-down design could have on
    my ability to stay productive while maintaing a high standard for code quality

What did you learn
    top-down design


What happened that you didn't expect?
    I realized top-down design paired perfectly with declarative, compositional programming

What would you change if you had to do it over again?
    I would've stopped worrying and just started writing tests sooner in my career

What would you tell someone attempting the same thing?
    Don't trust anyone! Listen to everyone and consider everything, but experiment a lot to figure
    out what you like and why. Take things to their logical extremes to truly understand the limits
    and depths of their utility.


Your talk should take no longer than 20 minutes; do practice and time yourself!



BRAIN STORMING

what is the purpose of high-level programming languages?
    the purpose of high-level programming languages is to help programmers encode programs in a way
    that clearly communicates intent to the humans that will be reading them by abstracting away
    low-level implementation details for compilers to handle for us

what is intent?
    intent is purpose. in programming terms, it's the intended result of evaluating an expression

what is abstraction?
    "The essence of abstractions is preserving information that is relevant in a given context, and
    forgetting information that is irrelevant in that context." - John Vogel Guttag

    abstraction helps us do more with less. consider spoken language: a ton of meaning can be
    packed into a single word without skipping a beat. a good abstraction is exactly like that! it
    allows you to express your intent in terms of the domain you're working in without dilluting it
    with implementation details. but an abstraction needs to be precisely defined, with a
    consistent meaning to be useful. in human languages, dictionaries precisely define every word
    in terms of other words - a beautiful example of recursive definition in the wild. yet even
    with dictionaries, we can run into trouble. sometimes the meaning of a word completely changes
    depending on the context it's used. words can be pronounced the same, but have different
    spelling depending on the meaning - and vice versa! this is all very confusing! abstractions
    that behave different depending on context can be just as confusing. the easiest abstractions
    to work with and most reliable to build others upon always exhibit the same behavior regardless
    of context. if we try to build abstractions on top of others where context matters, we might
    leak some irrelevant details unexpectedly.

what is an example of a good abstraction?
    pure functions! a pure function acts like a mapping of its inputs to an output. all possible
    inputs will always map to the same output. you never have to lift your scope of thought outside
    of the function to reason about what it does. but we're not completely home free. anything goes
    inside of a function as long as it always maps inputs to outputs. an entire application could
    be written inside of a pure function. what happens in the function matters if we want to
    consistently be expressing the intent of a function at a contextually appropriate level of
    abstraction. things like variables seem innocent, but each one ends up being a liability that
    you have to push to your mental stack in order to understand the function's intent.

what can be done?
    composition! and not just any composition - function composition. function composition allows
    us to create new abstractions exclusively in terms of existing abstractions without introducing
    any ad-hoc glue code. if you think about it, all software is a composition of abstractions. if
    we embrace this concept, we start to think about how software is built much differently. by
    focusing on composability, we get way more mileage out of the code we build because it can be
    used in contexts we didn't even consider when we wrote the code - because context doesn't
    matter to pure functions! this is a huge productivity boost! when we insist on expressing new
    abstractions on existing abstractions, we simultaneously stop reinventing the wheel. when we
    focus on just satisfying our immediate use case, we end up constantly reinventing countless
    tiny wheels, which greatly hinders our productivity. so how do we begin building things in this
    manner? from the top, of course!
