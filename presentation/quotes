The essence of abstractions is preserving information that is relevant in a given context, and forgetting information that is irrelevant in that context.

The key to understanding complicated things is knowing what not to look at.
- Gerald Jay Sussman

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
- Hal Abelson

When some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well,
it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use.
- Hal Abelson

This is the approach of statified design, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages.
Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level.
The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.

It is crucial that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used as a module in defining other procedures
- SICP

A user should not need to know how the procedure is implemented in order to use it.
- SICP

We can encourage modular design by providing a library of standard components together with a conventional interface for connecting the components in flexible ways.
- SICP

Current software practices fail to exploit the compositional potential within existing code; they encourage from-scratch development and coupled code.
This is unfortunate, because much expense in software stems from many versions of similar things.
Multiplied code means multiplied complexity and multiplied costs.
- Stephen Kell

I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing.
